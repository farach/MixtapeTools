# `/newproject` — Standard Project Scaffold

Invoked at the start of every new research project to create a consistent directory structure.

## Usage

```
/newproject my-project-name
```

## What It Creates

```
my-project-name/
├── CLAUDE.md              # Research rules & estimation philosophy (permanent)
├── README.md              # This file — project-specific notes

```

## Philosophy

### Two Configuration Files, Two Purposes

Every project has both a `CLAUDE.md` and a `README.md`. They serve different roles:

- **`CLAUDE.md`** is copied from a permanent template at `~/mixtapetools/claude/CLAUDE.md`. It contains research rules that apply across all sessions: estimation philosophy ("design before results"), coding conventions, collaborator information, and key methodological decisions. It is the *institutional memory* of the project — the file that keeps Claude aligned across conversations.

- **`README.md`** is auto-generated by this command and then edited as the project evolves. It is project-specific: what the research question is, who's involved, current status, and how files are organized. It's the file a human reads to understand the project.

### Session Continuity

The `progress_logs/` directory solves a real problem: Claude Code sessions don't persist. If a session crashes, times out, or you start fresh, the progress log tells the next session exactly where you left off. Logs are dated (`YYYY-MM-DD_description.md`) and maintained regularly.

### Documents and Decks

- `documents/` holds outside PDFs — papers you're reading, referee reports, data documentation. These are candidates for the `/split-pdf` skill, which splits large PDFs into safe 4-page chunks for reading.

- `decks/` holds Beamer presentations built following the rhetoric of decks philosophy (`~/mixtapetools/presentations/rhetoric_of_decks.md`). Titles are assertions, one idea per slide, beauty is function.

### Data Discipline

- `data/raw/` is **read-only** by convention. Original source data goes here and is never modified.
- `data/clean/` holds everything that's been transformed, merged, or constructed. Scripts in `code/` take raw data and produce clean data.

## Installation

This command lives at `~/mixtapetools/.claude/commands/newproject.md` and is also available as a skill at `~/mixtapetools/.claude/skills/newproject/SKILL.md`. Both are identical in behavior.

To make it available in any project, ensure `~/mixtapetools` is in your Claude Code skill search path, or symlink the `.claude` directory.
